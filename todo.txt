Architecture:
-------------
- build this to work on a local network initially
- in the future, public access would occur by proxying requests to the vps via tinc to the rpi rtmp url
- each camera runs it's own rtmp server
- user can use public site spa which will retrieve list of rtmp host names and embed those directly in browser
- camera would have api to control streaming, etc.

Todo:
-----
- create POST /devices/<device-guid>/start-live-feed
- create POST /devices/<device-guid>/stop-live-feed

- create POST /register-device
- create public spa where use can sign up and key in camera guid (last)
- add auth
