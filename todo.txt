Architecture:
-------------
- build this to work on a local network initially
- dont bother with dash or hls - just use rtmp/vlc
- in the future, public access would occur by proxying requests to the vps via tinc to the rpi rtmp url
- each camera runs it's own rtmp server


Todo:
-----
- focus on local network access for now
- add ability to send commands to each of the servers
- register each camera in centralized store (vps?)


- setup tinc for external access


- create POST /devices/<device-guid>/start-live-feed
- create POST /devices/<device-guid>/stop-live-feed
- add appropriate scripts

- create GET /cameras (to load urls in web page)
- change HTML file to come from SPA and use dynamic configs


- create POST /register-device
- create public spa where use can sign up and key in camera guid (last)
- add auth
