Architecture:
-------------
- build this to work on a local network initially
- in the future, public access would occur by proxying requests to the vps via tinc to the rpi rtmp url
- each camera runs it's own rtmp server
- user can use public site spa which will retrieve list of rtmp host names and embed those directly in browser
- camera would have api to control streaming, etc.

Todo:
-----
*updated 1-26-18 :)
1. install nginx w/rtmp on amazon lightsail server
2. publish rpi stream to lightsail server
